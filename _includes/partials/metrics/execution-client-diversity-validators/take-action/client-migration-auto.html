Migrate to a minority client using [Ethereum Client Switcher](https://github.com/accidental-green/client-switcher), an open source tool that helps instantly switch your execution client (Geth, Besu, Nethermind). This tool was developed by Accidental Green.

**Note**: The switcher assumes a "standard" installation based on [Somer Esat's Guides](https://github.com/SomerEsat/ethereum-staking-guides).
