  Validator client diversity is critical for network resiliency. If a single client is used by 2/3rds (66%) of validators, there's a very real risk this can result in disrupting the chain and monetary loss \[[1](https://www.slashed.info/), [2](https://nitter.net/_crypto_crack/status/1504459918539120643)] for node operators.

  It takes 2/3rds of validators to reach finality. If a client with 66%+ of marketshare has a bug and forks to its own chain, it'll be capable of finalizing. Once the fork finalizes, the **validators cannot return to the real chain without being slashed**. If 66% of the chain gets slashed simultaneously, the penalty is the whole 32 ETH.

  So why is >50% marketshare still dangerous? If a minority client forks, the 50%+ majority client can obtain a 66%+ majority. With no client having a marketshare over 33%, these scenarios are avoided. That's why **<33% marketshare is the goal for all clients**.

      [Use a staking pool](https://www.rated.network/?network=mainnet&view=pool&timeWindow=1d&page=1&poolType=all) that has better consensus client distribution, but a network penetration less than 22%.
